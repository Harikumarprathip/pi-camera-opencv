# pi-camera-opencv


As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, libcamera might not have a direct Python API, and it's more commonly used at the system level for camera stack improvements. However, you can still interact with the Raspberry Pi Camera Module using Python by using other available libraries.

If you want to capture images using Python without using picamera, you can consider using the cv2 library (OpenCV). Here's a basic example:


example captures a single frame from the camera using OpenCV (cv2) and saves it as "example_image.jpg". You might need to install OpenCV if you haven't already

Keep in mind that using picamera is a common and recommended approach for interfacing with the Raspberry Pi Camera Module in Python, and it provides more functionalities and better integration with the hardware. If you have specific reasons for not using it, using cv2 can be a viable alternative.
